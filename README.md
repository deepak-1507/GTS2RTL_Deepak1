# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program | VSD

---

> **Welcome, Explorer!**
>
> Embarking on the SoC Tapeout Program with VSD is more than just a technical journey—it's a leap into the future of India's semiconductor ecosystem. Here, every week brings new challenges, learnings, and the joy of building something truly impactful, hand-in-hand with 3500+ passionate learners and mentors.
>
> _“In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.”_
>
> This repository documents my week-by-week progress, milestones, and reflections as I grow through this transformative program.

## 🏗️ Design Process

| Step                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RTL Design**      | Register Transfer Level design using HDLs like Verilog or VHDL.              |
| **Synthesis**       | Convert RTL into gate-level netlist using logic synthesis tools.             |
| **Physical Design** | Placement and routing on silicon chip, floorplanning, power & clock design.  |
| **Tapeout Ready**   | Final verification & preparation for manufacturing (DRC, LVS checks, etc.)   |
