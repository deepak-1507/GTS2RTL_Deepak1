## üèóÔ∏è Design Process

| Step                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RTL Design**      | Register Transfer Level design using HDLs like Verilog or VHDL.              |
| **Synthesis**       | Convert RTL into gate-level netlist using logic synthesis tools.             |
| **Physical Design** | Placement and routing on silicon chip, floorplanning, power & clock design.  |
| **Tapeout Ready**   | Final verification & preparation for manufacturing (DRC, LVS checks, etc.)   |
