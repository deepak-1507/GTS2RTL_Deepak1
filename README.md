# 🚀 RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program – My VSD Journey

---

> **Greetings, Innovator!**
>
> Welcome to my chronicles of the VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program—a bold adventure shaping the next wave of India's semiconductor story! Every week brings fresh challenges and discoveries, all shared with a community of 3500+ fellow dreamers and doers.
>
> _“Here, I’m building a System-on-Chip (SoC) from the ground up—RTL to GDSII—using open-source tools. This is more than a course: it’s India’s largest RISC-V tapeout collaboration, uniting thousands to make real silicon and propel our nation’s tech future.”_
>
> Dive in to follow my milestones, lessons, and reflections as I grow through this transformative experience.

## 🛠️ Silicon Design Workflow

| Phase               | What Happens Here?                                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RTL Creation**    | Designing at the Register Transfer Level using Verilog/VHDL                  |
| **Logic Synthesis** | Translating RTL code to a gate-level netlist                                 |
| **Physical Layout** | Placing & routing components on silicon, power/clock/floorplanning           |
| **Tapeout Prep**    | Final sign-off: DRC, LVS, and handoff for chip fabrication                   |
